                <h1>About Smart Watches</h1>
                <p>Smart watches are a type of wearable technology that combine the functionality of a traditional
                    wristwatch with features of a smartphone or other mobile device. These watches typically have a
                    touch
                    screen interface and offer a range of features such as fitness tracking, mobile payment, and access
                    to
                    apps and notifications.</p>

                <p>Smart watches are a type of wearable technology that combine the functionality of a traditional
                    wristwatch with features of a smartphone or other mobile device. These watches typically have a
                    touch screen interface and offer a range of features such as fitness tracking, mobile payment, and
                    access to apps and notifications. Smart watches can also be synced with a smartphone to allow for
                    hands-free phone calls and messaging. Some smart watches are standalone devices that can make phone
                    calls and connect to the internet independently, while others require a smartphone to function. The
                    first commercially available smart watch was released by Sony in 2010, and since then, many other
                    companies have entered the market with their own offerings.</p>
